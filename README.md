# Exercise_StudentBE

Hello gaes!
Let's connect and collaborate!
Ps.

For facilitators:

Please create some branches to accommodate student assignments every topic and remind students to do a Pull Request before pushing their assignments. Example of the structure: branch "0_Java Introduction" has several student folders in this class and so on (please check our Curriculum - Standar Kompetensi)..

For students:

Please clone this repo so you can upload/push assignments into the branches that have been provided according to the learning activities each topic.
Thank you!
Happy coding! Cheers ;)
